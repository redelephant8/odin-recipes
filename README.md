For this second Odin Project "project", we were tasked to connect a series of recipes to one main document to work on our basic HTML skills. The biggest challenge I worked on was getting more familiar with Git and Github because I had some problems trying to commit changes, but after accomplishing that the project was pretty straight forward. I had a lot of fun working on this project and I can't wait to add some CSS for future projects.
